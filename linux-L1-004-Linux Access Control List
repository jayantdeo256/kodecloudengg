The Nautilus security team performed an audit on all servers present in Stratos DC.
During the audit some critical data/files were identified which were having the wrong permissions as per security standards.
Once the report was shared with the production support team, they started fixing the issues.
It has been identified that one of the files named /etc/hosts on Nautilus App 3 server has wrong permissions, so that needs to be fixed and the correct ACLs needs to be set.

1. The user owner and group owner of the file should be root user.
2. Others must have read only permissions on the file.
3. User ammar must not have any permission on the file.
4. User rod should have read only permission on the file.

solution:

chown root /etc/hosts
chgrp root /etc/hosts
chmod u+rwx /etc/hosts
chmod g+rwx /etc/hosts
chmod o+r-wx /etc/hosts

setfacl -m u:rod:r /etc/hosts
setfacl -m u:ammar:- /etc/hosts
