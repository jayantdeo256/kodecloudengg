The Nautilus team doesn't want its data to be accessed by any of the other groups/teams due to security reasons and want their data to be strictly accessed by the sysadmin group of the team.
Setup a collaborative directory /sysadmin/data on Nautilus App 3 server in Stratos Datacenter.
The directory should be group owned by the group sysadmin and the group should own the files inside the directory.
The directory should be read/write/execute to the group owners, and others should not have any access.

Solution:

sudo su
mkdir -p /sysadmin/data
chgrp -R sysadmin /sysadmin/
chmod -R 770 /dbadmin/
