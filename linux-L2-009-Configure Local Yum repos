The Nautilus production support team and security team had a meeting last month in which they decided to use local yum repositories for maintaing packages needed for their servers.
For now they have decided to configure a local yum repo on Nautilus Backup Server.
This is one of the pending items from last month, so please configure a local yum repository on Nautilus Backup Server as per details given below.

a. We have some packages already present at location /packages/downloaded_rpms/ on Nautilus Backup Server.
b. Create a yum repo named yum_local and make sure to set Repository ID to yum_local. Configure it to use package's location /packages/downloaded_rpms/.
c. Install package wget from this newly created repo.

solution:

sudo vi /etc/yum.repos.d/yum_local.repo

[yum_local]
name=yum_local
baseurl=file:///packages/downloaded_rpms/
enabled=1
gpgcheck=0

sudo yum install wget
