On Nautilus storage server in Stratos DC, there is a storage location named /data, which is used by different developers to keep their data (non confidential data).
One of the developers named siva has raised a ticket and asked for a copy of their data present in /data/siva directory on storage server.
/home is a FTP location on storage server itself where developers can download their data. 

Below are the instructions shared by the system admin team to accomplish this task.
a. Make a siva.tar.gz compressed archive of /data/siva directory and move the archive to /home directory on Storage Server.

Solution:

tar -zcvf siva.tar.gz /data/siva/
mv siva.tar.gz /home
