The Nautilus system admins team has prepared scripts to automate several day-to-day tasks.
They want them to be deployed on all app servers in Stratos DC on a set schedule. Before that they need to test similar functionality with a sample cron job. 
Therefore, perform the steps below:
a. Install cronie package on all Nautilus app servers and start crond service.
b. Add a cron */5 * * * * echo hello > /tmp/cron_text for root user.

Solution:

ssh tony@stapp01
yum install cronie -y

crontab -e
then paste following
*/5 * * * * echo hello > /tmp/cron_text
OR
create a file with any name like - abc, add '*/5 * * * * echo hello > /tmp/cron_text' in the file, then run below command
crontab abc

Do this in all the app servers.
