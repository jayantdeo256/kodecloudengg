Task:
During the monthly compliance meeting, it was pointed out that several servers in the Stratos DC do not have a valid banner. The security team has provided serveral approved templates which should be applied to the servers to maintain compliance. These will be displayed to the user upon a successful login.
Update the message of the day on all application and db servers for Nautilus. Make use of the approved template located at /home/thor/nautilus_banner on jump host

Solution:

scp /home/thor/nautilus_banner tony@stapp01:nautilus_banner

scp /home/thor/nautilus_banner steve@stapp02:nautilus_banner

scp /home/thor/nautilus_banner banner@stapp03:nautilus_banner

ssh peter@stdb01
sudo yum -y install openssh-clients
exit

scp /home/thor/nautilus_banner peter@stdb01:nautilus_banner

ssh tony@stapp01
sudo mv nautilus_banner /etc/motd
[tony@stapp01 ~]$ sudo systemctl restart sshd
