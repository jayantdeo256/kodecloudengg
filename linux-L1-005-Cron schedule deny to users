To stick with the security compliances, the Nautilus project team has decided to apply some restrictions on crontab access so that only allowed users can create/update the cron jobs.
Limit crontab access to below specified users on App Server 2.

Allow crontab access to james user and deny the same to jerome user.

Solution:

ssh steve@stapp02

vi /etc/cron.allow
james

vi /etc/cron.deny
jerome
